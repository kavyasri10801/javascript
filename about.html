<p>Dr Reddy s Foundation (DRF) is a not-for-profit organization committed to enabling economically and socially vulnerable groups to take control of their lives. Set up in 1996 by Dr Anji Reddy as a result of his faith in the innate capacity of the human being for progress when provided with an appropriate environment; the organization focuses on education, livelihood, health and nutrition. We develop and test innovative solutions to address adaptive social problems and support scaling up of impact by leveraging the power of partnerships. We work with Children, Youth (including Persons with Disabilities) Women and Households in 20 States in India.
